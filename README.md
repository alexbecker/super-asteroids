super-asteroids
-----------------

An ncurses-based version of asteroids played in the terminal.
You cannot turn, but you can fire missiles in any direction.
What makes it "super" is that by pressing the space bar, you change the identification of the screen edges.
This means you can play on a topological torus or a topological Klein bottle.

CONTROLS:
	W - accelerate up
	A - accelerate left
	S - accelerate down
	D - accelerate right
	U - fire up
	H - fire left
	J - fire down
	K - fire right
	SPACE - change topology
	ENTER - quit
